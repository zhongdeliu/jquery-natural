> Here is a short jQuery (any version) plugin that adds two methods: naturalWidth() and naturalHeight(). It uses branching to determine if naturalWidth and naturalHeight are supported by the browser. If supported, the method just becomes a getter for the naturalWidth or naturalHeight property. If not supported, the method creates a new unstyled image element and returns that element's actual width and height.
